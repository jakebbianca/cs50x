            <p>
              I have a small obsession with finding unique, aesthetically pleasing sounds in the music I listen to. Here is a small collection of 10 songs that I feel all utilize
              instruments or sound techniques that you just don't elsewhere in the former's case or nearly to the same effect in the latter's affect. In 'Low Key Gliding',
              Hal Walker is playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khene">southeast-Asian khaen</a>, a member of the same broad family of instruments as the
              harmonica and accordion. In 'Wakanda', Ludwig Goransson utilizes mulitple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_drum">talking drums</a>
              in a portion of the track which is quite unlike anything I had heard before seeing the movie in theaters. tl;dr: weird

            <p>
              Amongst my friends and family, I have always been the 'music guy'. I DJ the parties, I own the aux cord on car rides, I make music of my own, and I am constantly searching
              for new music to listen to and love. I have introduced so many different songs which have stuck with one friend that he even coined the term 'Jake songs', generally referring
              to any song that I played which sounded good but nobody else really knew about before then. Anecdote aside, this playlist contains 10 songs that I have been jamming to recently
              which I find to be underappreciated. This isn't to say these are particularly deep cuts, but they are all songs that I loved since first listen and found of my own accord.

            <p>
              I tend to fall in love with music in the visual and interactive media I consume. A good soundtrack will amplify the moment, but a great soundtrack will become something
              just as great as the moment itself -- that is to say, it will be just as worthwhile as the media it is paired with. The first few tracks of this playlist are strong evidence
              of this, as 'The Ecstasy of Gold' has become quite a famous piece of music in its own right (I personally heard it long before learning it was attached to a film) and
              'Killmonger' brings unique instrumenation to a trap-style instrumental.

            <p>
              This playlist's central theme is simple: all of these songs remind me distinctly of my time at UConn as an undergrad. A lot of my strongest memories are tied to sound, and these
              tracks all bring a tidal wave of images and conversations I can recall from friends, lectures, parties, homework, running, and even the alone time I spent in my dorm up in Storrs.
              Not unlike many others I'm sure, the music I was listening to at this time is permanently intertwined with the experiences I was so fortunate to have living on my own at
              university. Special mention goes to the late, great Van McCoy for 'The Hustle'.

              It's no secret to those who know me that I run the dance floor, or at least I think that I do. I'll dance to just about anything with a good rhythm, but here are ten tracks
              that get me right out of my seat. Enough talk -- time to dance!
