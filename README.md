This is my (remaining) collection of submissions for CS50x and CS50w, two of Harvard's online, self-paced,
self-taught computer science courses.

These courses are the bedrock of my computer science and programming knowledge, and I absolutely recommend them to
anyone who may be interested.

There are a few missing submissions from this collection, but the progression from learning the basics to building 
larger-scale projects is still evident and, for me, nostalgic. Starting from Scratch (literally, MIT's Scratch), 
I learned how to say "Hello World", the basics of how we can use software to manipulate the hardware in front of 
us, and how to simply exist in a command terminal. By the end, I was able to create full-blown web apps, 
make user-focused design decisions, and even take the core skills I learned to my professional life for use in 
completely different contexts than I had ever programmed in for the purpose of these classes. As it turns out, with
the essential lessons of computer science, an understanding of programming logic, a lot of practice precisely searching
the internet for others who have been where you have been, and plenty of patience, you can do just about anything you 
set your focus on.

Though they may never read this, thank you to Professor David J. Malan, Brian Yu, Doug Lloyd, Tommy MacWilliam, and
everyone else who helped to provide one of the most fun and inspiring learning experiences of my life, even in the 
context of an online course with no direct interaction. One fateful day in March of 2020 I decided I was going to 
see what programming and computer science were all about, and I was fortunate enough to find CS50.

P.S. If you're currently on your own journey through CS50 and have found your way to this repo, LEAVE NOW. Obvious 
academic dishonesty aside, you are really cheating yourself out of the opportunity to perservere and achieve in a 
way that you may not have thought possible. If there is one universal lesson I carry from my time with CS50, it is 
that you can accomplish so much if you simply don't give up. I think we've all been there, staring at our code and 
wondering why on Earth the thing isn't working the way we expect it to, and there are few feelings greater than 
the bliss of finally seeing all of the tests go green.
