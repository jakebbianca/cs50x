        <p class="pLong">
            I wrote the code for this website for the purpose of completing the 'Homepage' assignment for the Web track as a part of the CS50x course offered by Harvard. The course so far
            has been an excellent introduction to the world of computer programming and continues to teach me while feeding my newfound curiosity in the field! I plan to complete this course
            and continue my learning in order to begin my career in computer science.

            Thank you for viewing the first website I have ever put together! Special thanks to anybody who helped create CS50x!
