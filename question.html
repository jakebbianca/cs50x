                    Perhaps one of the most controversial topics of the modern era, it seems that almost anybody you pose this question to will answer immediately and with conviction.
                    It's rarely something one would consider to think about on it's own, as after all, who really cares? Whether you like to eat hot dogs or you don't, it's not particularly
                    important to know which vague categories or food groups they belong to. However, you can discover quite easily by asking a few people that even though this may not be
                    a conscious thought for most, pretty much everybody who's grown up attending picnics, barbecues, and ball games where these split-bread weiner constructions get served up
                    will have an immediate subconscious stance come to light.

                    To answer this question, we must first ask: what makes a sandwich? Only once we have defined the category can we decide if the hot dog belongs. We can look to other examples
                    of clear sandwich family members for inspiration. The reuben or turkey club, clearly placed on two separate slices of bread and filled with the classic ingredients of
                    meat, cheese, and vegetables, we can expect to be almost unanimously to be sandwiches. After all, if these are not, what is? Let's look at this quick guide to cover many
                    possibilities we have across the ingredients and structure spectrum:

                    Most people I talk to who are firmly in the 'not a sandwich' camp fall into one of two categories. They are either structural neutrals and ingredient purists,
                    meaning that they believe a sub is a sandwich but draw the line when less traditional ingredients come into play, or they are actually a bit more casual on the ingredients
                    spectrum but completely inflexible when it comes to the hot dog as its own non-sandwich entity. The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council spoke on the latter in 2015, officially
                    stating that calling hot dogs sandwiches is <a href="https://www.hot-dog.org/culture/hot-dog-sandwich">like calling the Dalai Lama â€˜just a guy'."</a>
                    Others have argued semantics, claiming that you would never ask for a "hot dog sandwich" and that "hot dog" could refer to just the weiner itself.
                    I find this all to be complete nonsense.

                    There is an overarching theme in anti-sandwich arguments I've mentioned that the hot dog is an exception. They consider it to be something greater than a simple sandwich.
                    I can absolutely agree that hot dogs are as culturally relevant to the United States as apple pie, and certainly have a special place in the heart of many Americans, myself
                    included. However, this doesn't change the fact that a hot dog clearly meets the criteria to be called a sandwich.
                    Both <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sandwich">Merriam-Webster</a> and <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sandwich">Dictionary.com</a> present
                    definitions which include open sandwiches (like the sub and hot dog) without any special mention of sausages, frankfurters, or the like being excluded. This matches my
                    stance, and is where I try to find some common ground with the sandwich doubters. The hot dog by any accepted definition will be a sandwich, but it is a special sandwich,
                    so much so that you need not specify the sandwich status when referencing one. The same goes for a club, a reuben, a BLT, and so on; it would be redundant to call a frank on
                    a split roll a "hot dog sandwich".

                    Looking beyond just the hot dog, lines must still be drawn if we are to decide once and for all exactly what is and is not a sandwich. That is not a question I will be
                    answering here. Instead, I would like to leave you today with a new question, one that is arguably just as controversial as the subject of this article...
